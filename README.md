# MojeKlima DMP - UI (React)

## Overview
This project was developed as part of my high school graduation requirements. It showcases some of my skills in front-end development, utilizing modern web technologies.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: The primary UI library used for building the user interface.
- **GraphQL**: Utilized for connecting to and exchanging data with the backend.
- **PWA Elements**: Implements basic Progressive Web App features, such as a service worker.
- **NPM**: For package management.
- **HTTPS Certificates**: Included in the project for service worker to work in the development environment.

## Deployment
- **School Servers**: This project was designed for and deployed on school servers, which may affect its functionality in different environments.

## Future Plans
- **Next.js Migration**: I plan to rewrite the web client using Next.js to enhance maintainability and performance.

Please be aware that due to the [backend](https://github.com/RamoFX/mojeklima-api-php) changes, the frontend may not fully interact with the current backend setup.
